# Android_p2p_chat

i tried to use ffmpeg software but i didn't syncronize each device.

so i found alternative solution. it's libstreaming library.

libstreaming library use rtsp server and it's really simple.

How to use
1. run server 
2. install app in your android phone
3.just chat... actually this app suports 1:1 video chat and text chatting
